compile:
  # Compile tests on multiple Arduino platforms
  platforms:
    - uno          # Standard AVR platform
    - due          # SAM platform
    - m4           # SAMD platform (Adafruit Feather M4 or similar)
    # Add additional platforms if needed, like STM32 or ESP32
    # - mega2560    # If needed for expanded AVR testing
    # - stm32:disco_f407vg # Example STM32 board, adjust for your target board

unittest:
  # Unit test platforms and dependencies
  platforms:
    - uno          # Native host system (Linux in this case)
  libraries:
    - "OneWire"     # Ensure OneWire library is available for testing
